# cmpm121
unity project for cmpm121
My scene is a collection of planets in space, each of the planets rotate around the center planet in the middle.
There were 3 main object types for this scene, first was the planets which have a script to rotate around eachother.
Secondly is the main spaceship (the one you can control). And lastly is the camera system that has cameras around in
random parts of the generated galaxy. It was not really a conscious 'inspiration' but looking back on what I have made
Outer Wilds was most certanly an inspiration for this project, I mainly just wanted to create a cool space field and I 
found an asset pack that I liked. The main character in this scene is the space ship that you control.
